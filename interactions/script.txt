[get up and feed cat]
You unscrew the plastic bin at the base of your bed and scoop out a mix of smoked fish bits and dehydrated squirrel. Homemade cat food. The smell is

<CHAR_1> CONVO

<char_1> : Hey Alex, I know you didn't sign up for early chores today, but...

(if empathy is high) <char_1> is sweating.

char_1<>: Sorry I haven't really been checking in with you lately. I haven't really felt comfortable in the big house lately.
